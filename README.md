# Smart Suggestor
## Build Your Own suggestor web app!

## What is this?
This is a web app that anyone can use to make suggester web apps themselves without much coding skills!

## A suggester?
You have a page with a question and few options. Then clicking an option either gives you another question with another set of options OR you get to a final page where there is some sort of description.

## How do I create my own suggester?
This app will have an interface where you can create your own questions and answers.
You then save them into a JSON file (done when you click the save button). 
Finally you setup the application following some intructions onto a hosting and your custom suggestor is live on the internet!
